# mediterranean-restaurant

This website for a non-existent restaurant is the project made for the course “Front-End Web Development with React”, from the University of Hong Kong.

It is made with Bootstrap, React and Redux, using Git as a backup. It uses the json-server as a static web server, which makes data available for clients. The node_modules folder has not been committed, but all other files and components can be seen above. You can see some images  of the project below.

Home and About pages:

The dishes’ details page has the option to submit a new comment, while the contact page has a contact form. There is also a login button at the top of the page. These were made through uncontrolled forms components in React and controlled forms in react-redux-form. It has the capability to store the form’s state in the Redux store, in case the user leaves the page and later returns and wants to continue writing.



The website uses basic animations for the page’s content, made using react-transition-group and react-animation-components. You can see the effect when the user opens each page:
